        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Candidiasis</strong>, commonly known as a yeast infection or moniliasis, is a fungal infection caused by the overgrowth of <em>Candida</em> species, most often <em>Candida albicans</em>. It can affect various parts of the body, including the mouth (oral thrush), skin, and genital areas. Genital candidiasis is one of the most common types, particularly among women.</br>People who don't have sex can get a vaginal yeast infection. So it isn't though of as a sexually transmitted infection. But you can get vaginal yeast infections through sex.</p>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Candidiasis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Overgrowth of <em>Candida</em> due to a weakened immune system.</li>
            <li>Use of antibiotics, which disrupt the balance of natural bacteria.</li>
            <li>Hormonal changes, such as during pregnancy or menstruation.</li>
            <li>Uncontrolled diabetes, which increases sugar levels in mucous membranes.</li>
            <li>Poor hygiene or wearing tight, non-breathable clothing.</li>
            <li>Sexual activity, though it is not classified as a sexually transmitted infection (STI).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="symptoms">
        <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of candidiasis vary depending on the affected area:</p>
        <ul>
            <strong>Genital Candidiasis:</strong>
            Yeast infection symptoms range from mild to moderate. They may include:
            <li>Itching and irritation in the vagina and tissues at the vaginal opening, called the vulva.</li>
            <li>A burning feeling, mainly during intercourse or while urinating.</li>
            <li>Redness and swelling of the vulva.</li> 
            <li> Redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin than on white skin.</li>
            <li>Vaginal pain and soreness.</li>
            <li>Thick, white vaginal shedding of fluid and cells, called discharge, with little or no odor. The discharge looks like cottage cheese</li>
        </ul>
            <strong>Oral Thrush:</strong> White patches on the tongue or inner cheeks, soreness, and difficulty swallowing.</br>
            <strong>Skin Candidiasis:</strong> Red, itchy rashes, often in skin folds.
        
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Complicated yeast infection</h2>
        <p>You might have a complicated yeast infection if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have severe symptoms, such as a lot of redness, swelling and itching that leads to tears, cracks or sores in the vagina.</li>
            <li>You have four or more yeast infections in a year.</li>
            <li>Your infection is caused by a less common type of fungus.</li>
            <li>You're pregnant.</li>
            <li>You have diabetes that isn't well-managed.</li>
            <li>Your immune system is weakened because of certain medicines or conditions such as HIV infection.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2> When to see a Doctor?</h2>
    <p>Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the first time you've had symptoms of a yeast infection.</li>
        <li>You're not sure whether you have a yeast infection.</li>
        <li>Your symptoms don't go away after you treat them with antifungal vaginal creams or suppositories that you can get without a prescription.</li>
        <li>You have other symptoms.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Risk factors">
        <h2>Risk factors</h2>
        <p>Factors that raise the risk of getting a yeast infection include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Antibiotic use.</strong> Yeast infections are common in people who take antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a range of bacteria. They also kill healthy bacteria in the vagina. This can lead to too much yeast.</li>
            <li><strong>Raised estrogen levels.</strong> Yeast infections are more common in people with higher estrogen levels. Pregnancy, birth control pills and hormone therapy can raise estrogen levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Diabetes that isn't well-managed.</strong> People with poorly managed blood sugar are at greater risk of yeast infections than are people with well-managed blood sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Weakened immune system.</strong> People with lowered immunity are more likely to get yeast infections. Lower immunity might be from corticosteroid therapy or HIV infection or other diseases that suppress the immune system.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="difference">
        <h2>How Candidiasis Differs from Other Genital Infections</h2>
        <p>Candidiasis is often confused with bacterial vaginosis or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like trichomoniasis. Key differences include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discharge:</strong> Candidiasis causes a thick, white, odorless discharge, while bacterial vaginosis produces a thin, grayish discharge with a fishy odor.</li>
            <li><strong>Itching:</strong> Candidiasis is typically associated with intense itching, which is less common in other infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Candidiasis is caused by a fungus, whereas STIs are caused by bacteria or parasites.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Diagnosis">
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>To diagnose a yeast infection, your healthcare professional may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ask about your medical history.</strong> This might include past vaginal infections or sexually transmitted infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Do a pelvic exam.</strong> This involves looking at your outer genitals for signs of infection. Then your healthcare professional puts an instrument called a speculum into your vagina. The speculum holds the vaginal walls open so the vagina and cervix are easy to see. The cervix is the lower, narrower part of the uterus.</li>
            <li><strong>Test vaginal fluids.</strong>Lab tests of vaginal fluid can look for yeast or find the type of fungus causing the yeast infection. Knowing the fungus can help your healthcare professional suggest treatment.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment Options </h2>
        <p>Treatment for yeast infections depends on how bad the infections are and how often they happen.</p>
        <p>If you have mild to moderate symptoms and don't get infections often, treatment options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-course vaginal therapy:</strong>Using an antifungal medicine for 3 to 7 days most often clears a yeast infection. Antifungal medicines come in the form of creams, ointments, tablets and small objects you put into your vagina, called suppositories. They include miconazole (Monistat 3) and terconazole. You can get these medicines with or without a prescription.</li>
            <li><strong> One dose of medicine taken by mouth:</strong> Your healthcare professional might prescribe one dose of fluconazole (Diflucan). To manage severe symptoms, you might take two doses three days apart. Oral medicine is not used often in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Remedies:</strong> Probiotics, yogurt, and maintaining proper hygiene can help prevent recurrence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Treatment for yeast infections that have severe symptoms or that happen often might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-course vaginal therapy.</strong> You use an antifungal medicine daily for up to two weeks. Then you take it once a week for six months.</li>
            <li><strong>More than one dose of medicine taken by mouth.</strong> You take 2 to 3 doses of an antifungal medicine by mouth instead of having vaginal therapy. But this therapy isn't for pregnant people.</li>
            <li><strong>Boric acid therapy.</strong> You t have boric acid in a capsule put into your vagina. This medicine may be fatal if taken by mouth. It only treats candida fungus that doesn't respond to other treatments. It is not recommended for use in pregnancy.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain good hygiene and dry the genital area thoroughly after bathing.</li>
            <li>Avoid wearing tight, synthetic underwear; opt for breathable cotton fabrics.</li>
            <li>Limit the use of antibiotics unless prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li>Manage blood sugar levels if you have diabetes.</li>
            <li>Avoid douching, as it disrupts the natural balance of bacteria.</li>
            <li>Do not stay in wet clothes, such as swimsuits and workout clothes, for longer than needed.</li>
            <li>Do not use scented products in the vaginal area. For instance, don't use scented bubble bath, soap, menstrual pads and tampons</li>
        </ul>
